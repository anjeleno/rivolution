# Backlog

Known technical debt and deferred fixes — things we've found, scoped,
and deliberately decided not to fix yet, with the reasoning for why.
This is **not** a feature roadmap or pipeline of planned work; see
`docs/specs/` for that. Entries here get promoted to a real spec and
branch once they're picked up.

## RD_CURL_TIMEOUT orphans server-side conversions on large/slow imports

`RD_CURL_TIMEOUT` (`lib/rd.h:514`, 1200s) is shared by every HTTP-based
audio transfer (`rdimport`, Dropbox, the RDLibrary Import/Export
dialog). After 20 minutes the *client* gives up and reports an error,
but the *server* (`rdxport.cgi`) isn't told to stop — it keeps
converting to completion regardless, fully orphaned, burning CPU for
however long the conversion actually takes. Pre-existing upstream
behavior, not introduced by this fork.

**Scoped a fix (2026-06-18), then deferred it** — turned out
materially bigger than expected:
- `lib/rdaudioconvert.cpp`'s decode/encode work is spread across ~15
  separate format-specific loops, not one — a naive "check for
  disconnect" hook would touch the core conversion engine shared by
  every caller (imports, exports, voice tracker, CD ripper).
- `rdxport.cgi`'s stdout is the HTTP response body itself, parsed by
  the client as one complete XML document at the end — any heartbeat
  write mid-conversion to detect a dead connection would corrupt that
  XML and break every successful import too.
- The clean design: fork the actual conversion into a child process
  (writing only to the destination file), while the parent
  periodically `poll()`s its own stdout for `POLLHUP`/`POLLERR` (a
  read-only check, no protocol corruption) and kills the child early
  if the client's gone. Contained to `import.cpp`/`export.cpp`, but
  means adding `fork()`/process-management code to a **setuid-root CGI
  binary** (`rdxport.cgi` installs `chown root; chmod 4755`) —
  meaningfully more delicate than a quick patch.

**Current mitigation:** none server-side. Operationally, keep imports
well under the 20-minute mark. See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for the
user-facing version of this.

**Needs to be fixed before any public install** of this fork — an
unfamiliar submitter or station can't be relied on to always stay
under the timeout. Not urgent for current single-station use.

## caed's MPEG playback path doesn't resample mismatched-rate audio

Full trace and planned fix shape: see "Known issue, deferred" in
`docs/specs/0001-mp3-import-format.md`. Short version: `caed`
(`cae/driver_alsa.cpp`'s `WAVE_FORMAT_MPEG` case) never applies the
sample-rate-correction `ratio` that the PCM/Vorbis cases already do, so
any MP3 file whose real sample rate doesn't match the system's output
rate plays back pitch-shifted. The MP3-import passthrough feature gates
around this (only passes through when rates match — see spec 0001),
but the underlying engine bug is real and would affect any MP3 file at
a mismatched rate from any source, not just passthrough.

**Current mitigation:** the passthrough gate (fixed 2026-06-18) plus an
operational policy — all submitted mixes must be encoded at the
system's configured sample rate (48kHz on this fork's default install).

**Deliberately deferred** to its own future branch — `cae/driver_alsa.cpp`
is the live audio output path, the highest-risk code in this project
(same reasoning that put segue back-timing on its own branch rather
than bundling it into the import-feature work).

**Needs to be fixed before any public install** — can't assume every
future submitter/station will always encode at the system rate.

## Log generation doesn't exclude kill-dated carts from rotation — likely a regression

**High priority** — flagged 2026-06-19 as needing a fix soon, not
deferred indefinitely like the other entries here.

A promo cart (cart 064721, "Live at Swan Dive LV") had a kill date of
8PM the next day. A script that auto-generates the music log three
days out kept scheduling that same cart into logs for days *after* its
kill date had already passed, instead of excluding it from rotation
and picking another active cart in the same category. The result
wasn't a quiet skip — the scheduler placed the expired cart into the
log anyway, and the Log Exception Report then flagged every one of
those slots as "is not playable" (20 exceptions in one observed case,
for log `2026_06_23`).

Manually swapping the expired promo for an active one in the rotation
fixed the report for logs generated *after* the swap — but the
underlying bug isn't really about any one already-generated log: as
long as an expired cart remains a member of a category's rotation, the
scheduler will keep selecting it for any newly-generated log, kill date
or not. Suspected regression — reported as not happening in earlier
Rivendell versions, though not yet bisected to confirm or to a specific
upstream change.

**Current mitigation:** manually remove/replace kill-dated carts from
their rotation category before they expire, rather than relying on the
scheduler to skip them automatically. See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for the
user-facing version.

**Deferred for now** at the reporter's request — not investigated yet,
but tracked here as the next thing to pick up given the priority.

## xrdp/dbus session-bus bug after a host reboot or xrdp restart

"Could not acquire name on session bus" black-screen error, hit
repeatedly on both this dev VM and the production on-air machine.
Likely a stale per-user `dbus-daemon`/`systemd --user` instance left
behind by an orphaned xrdp session, holding a bus name a fresh login
can't reacquire. Not a Rivendell bug — an Ubuntu/xrdp interaction.

**Current mitigation:** full host reboot (the only proven fix so far).
Disruptive on a live on-air machine.

**Deferred** — needs investigation into a lighter-weight fix (e.g.
`loginctl terminate-session`, killing the stale per-user bus) suitable
for a machine that can't just be rebooted on demand. Low priority since
the reboot workaround, while disruptive, reliably works.
